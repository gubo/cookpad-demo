as tested on nexus 4 phone (android 5.1.1)

1. overall too busy ... on small device (phone) should be simpler and cleaner
2. scrolling is clumsy and bad experience ... is interrupted for network fetches
3. why not open up recipe/api format ?
4. why using socket connection instead of https rest calls ?
5. on main screen, have to go to new activity to do general search ? ... seems most basic function
6. left / right sliders are fancy, but too much info for user at same activity ... also not in keeping
   with activity-stack paradigm
7. with left and right sliders, seems keep lot of info in memory ?
8. main scrolling lists are too busy ... too much info is presented, when i just want to see nice picture
   of recipe ... then i can 'drill-down' for more detailed information (standard ui patrtern)
9. the low-resolution placeholder doesnt add any user-value in my opinion, may waste memory / bandwidth ?
10. when re-orientate (rotate) device, my position in scrolling list is lost and list is reset at beginning ...
   should persist the backing-list thru activity/fragment lifecycle for orientation change
11. if i lose network connection (ex. airplane mode) then app error occurred and can not see a list again
   until i go out and come back in app ... maybe need to think about adopting a sync architecture
12. what is 'nearby' tab mean ? from recipes posted by people near me ?
